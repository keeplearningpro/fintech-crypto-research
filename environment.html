      Technologies used in Blockchain like particularly proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism used by Bitcoin has come under a lot of scrutiny due to its massive environmental impact.  Proof of Work mechanisms have a heavy energy consumption and related carbon emissions. The PoW mechanism works on the principle where global miners performing energy intensive computations to secure the network and validate transactions. As the popularity of Bitcoin and mining activity became more famous,  its energy footprint also grew.  This is now making people worry about carbon emissions, electricity use and electronic waste all of which affect the environment.

      <b>Energy Consumption: </b>
      The energy use of Bitcoin is huge  with annual consumption estimated between 100 and 170 TWh. To put things into perspective, this amount of electricity is comparable to the electricity consumption of countries like Poland or Pakistan and about 0.4% of global electricity demand. The main reason behind such high consumption is a result of the competitive nature of mining. In this process thousands of miners expend energy but only one is rewarded. Other PoW-based cryptocurrencies also contribute to this consumption. However Bitcoin remains the largest electricity consumer. Studies such as those by Tayebi and Amini have documented the extensive energy use and associated environmental harm, comparing the energy footprint of Bitcoin to that of data centers or industrial nations.

        <b>Carbon Emissions: </b>
        As a consequence of high energy consumption, the problem extends beyond that to the carbon footprint associated with electricity generation. In 2022, Cambridge estimated the annual greenhouse gas emissions of Bitcoin as 48.4 MtCO‚ÇÇe which is about 0.1% of global GHG emissions.  This is almost similar to the GHG emissions similar to countries like Nepal. Other estimates place this figure even higher, depending on assumptions about the energy mix used. Although some industry bodies claim Bitcoin mining uses up to 60% renewable energy, independent studies suggest the real share is closer to one-third of the claimed amount. According to a UN study, coal and natural gas are still the major sources of the Bitcoin energy mix which highlights the environmental harm caused by them. Tayebi and Amini also emphasize the negative effects of PoW mining on both air quality and climate change.

        <b>Electronic Waste: </b>
        Another environmental concern of PoW approach is the electronic waste it generates.  Most of the e-waste is generated by outdated mining hardware. ASIC miners which are the specialized devices used in Bitcoin mining have short life cycles. These contribute to a large volume of  e-waste annually. There are also concerns about land and water usage where electricity generation for mining needs cooling infrastructure. According to the UN, water consumption in 2020‚Äì21 for Bitcoin energy generation was equivalent to a few hundred thousands of swimming pools used in Olympic games. The large-scale environmental cost of proof-of-work mining is shown by these hidden effects.

        <b>Mitigation Strategies and Alternatives: </b>
        The fintech industry is increasingly exploring ways to address blockchain‚Äôs environmental issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): </b>
        One of the most impactful changes has been switch from PoW to PoS via the Merge upgrade of Ethereum in 2022. This approach removed mining and replaced it with an approach known as validator staking. This reduced the  energy use of Ethereum by over 99.9%. PoW consumption of 21 TWh/year dropped to just 0.224 MW after implementation of this Merge approach. The large scale  success of this validator staking approach has prompted broader discussions about the feasibility of shifting other cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin to alternative consensus mechanisms. Many newer blockchains  for example, Cardano, Solana, Algorand already use PoS or other energy-efficient models.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Increased Use of Renewable Energy: </b>
        Cryptocurrency miners are gradually relocating their operations near renewable energy sources like hydroelectric or geothermal plants. Some mining operations are now relying on excess wind or solar power for their operations. They are even aiming to capture flared natural gas to reduce net emissions. With time the industry is moving towards a carbon-neutral or carbon-negative goals. The main driving force for these initiatives are coming from public scrutiny and cost benefits. Research shows a 20% rise in renewable energy adoption in recent decades, indicating a gradual shift toward sustainability.
