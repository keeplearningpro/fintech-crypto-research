      Technologies used in Blockchain like particularly proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism used by Bitcoin has come under a lot of scrutiny due to its massive environmental impact.  Proof of Work mechanisms have a heavy energy consumption and related carbon emissions. The PoW mechanism works on the principle where global miners performing energy intensive computations to secure the network and validate transactions. As the popularity of Bitcoin and mining activity became more famous,  its energy footprint also grew.  This is now making people worry about carbon emissions, electricity use and electronic waste all of which affect the environment.

      <b>Energy Consumption: </b>
      The energy use of Bitcoin is huge  with annual consumption estimated between 100 and 170 TWh. To put things into perspective, this amount of electricity is comparable to the electricity consumption of countries like Poland or Pakistan and about 0.4% of global electricity demand. The main reason behind such high consumption is a result of the competitive nature of mining. In this process thousands of miners expend energy but only one is rewarded. Other PoW-based cryptocurrencies also contribute to this consumption. However Bitcoin remains the largest electricity consumer. Studies such as those by Tayebi and Amini have documented the extensive energy use and associated environmental harm, comparing the energy footprint of Bitcoin to that of data centers or industrial nations.
