      One of the most significant barriers to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption is security. Unlike traditional financial institutions cryptocurrencies do not manage security centrally. These currencies expect individuals to secure their own wallets and private keys. This decentralization is indeed empowering for some users but at the same time has made users increasingly vulnerable to hacks, scams, and fraud.
    <p>
      In recent years, the cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed high-profile breaches and exploitations. According to Chainalysis, 2022 recorded over $3.7 billion in stolen crypto assets, mostly from decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. While the amount dropped to $1.7 billion in 2023, the number of incidents actually rose, indicating persistent vulnerabilities. High-profile cases like the Euler Finance ($197M) and Curve Finance ($73M) exploits in 2023, and the collapse of FTX amid suspected fraud and a $600 million outflow, have shaken confidence in the ecosystem. These incidents are not limited to technical breaches. Sophisticated scams exploiting human psychology like phishing, Ponzi schemes and fake investment opportunities have surged. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported over $1 billion in crypto fraud losses in the U.S. from 2021 to Q1 2022 with a median individual loss of $2,600. Scammers often use social media platforms, exploiting the emotional and cognitive vulnerabilities of users such as fear of missing out (FOMO), overconfidence or low tech literacy. Regulatory inconsistency further complicates the issue. While countries like Japan and the UK integrate crypto into existing financial systems, others like the U.S. adopt fragmented approaches, and China has issued outright bans. This lack of global alignment makes it difficult to enforce consumer protections effectively.

      To understand real user sentiment, I conducted a survey of 40 participants, asking four key questions:
      Do you have any investment in cryptocurrency?
      On a scale of 1 to 5, how much do you trust crypto platforms to keep your funds secure?
      Which of the following security concerns most affects your trust in cryptocurrency?
      Have you or someone you know experienced a crypto-related security breach?
      The findings were eye-opening:

      From the survey results we can see that only 23% of respondents currently invest in crypto. Another 15% showed interest in future investments, but 62% were skeptical or disinterested altogether.This has illustraled in the pie chart below.

      Trust in crypto platforms is low‚Äîjust 8% fully trust them, while 55% express strong doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly, although 70% haven‚Äôt experienced or known someone affected by a breach, skepticism remains high‚Äîimplying distrust is driven more by perception than direct experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most commonly cited security concerns were hacking risks, lack of regulation, and scams, with some also worried about the irreversible nature of transactions.These findings are reflected in the pie charts included on this page, helping visualize how public sentiment aligns with the broader challenges facing the industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The survey reinforces a key insight: trust is essential for fintech to fulfill its promise. While blockchain enables decentralized innovation, its benefits will only be realized if platforms can offer security on par with traditional systems. Encouragingly, the industry is taking steps‚Äîimproving infrastructure, conducting smart contract audits, and exploring insured, regulated custodial solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, overcoming these trust issues will be pivotal for cryptocurrency to become a secure and accepted part of the global financial ecosystem.
