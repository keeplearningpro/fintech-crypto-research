    <p>Cryptocurrency networks now handle a substantial volume of transactions worldwide, reflecting their growing adoption. On-chain transaction volume which means the total value of crypto transferred on blockchain ledgers is of the order of trillions of US dollars per year. For example, Chainalysis data indicate that from July 2022 to June 2023, North America alone accounted for about $1.2 trillion in cryptocurrency received on-chain, representing roughly 24.4% of global transaction activity. What thus implies is that a global on-chain transaction value of around $4.9‚Äì5.0 trillion for that 12-month period. The oldest and largest cryptocurrency network is Bitcoin and it regularly processes billions of dollars in transfers daily. Late in 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain transfer volumes surged to over $5 billion per day, up from roughly $2.4 billion/day earlier in the year(6). Similarly  Ethereum network also handles a significant volume of transactions. The volume of transactions of Etherium is some what on the order of 1 million transactions per day. This not only facilitates transfers of its native Ether (ETH) but also a vast array of tokens and smart contract operations. These figures highlight that crypto networks are being used extensively for value transfer.  This is in turn leading to increased competition with some traditional payment networks in throughput although both of them have important differences in terms of usage and capacity.  
To put these findings into perspective, we analysed monthly transaction volumes of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the last 10 years using data available in the public datasets in Bigquery and our analysis is presented below in the form of graphical representation which shows how these cryptocurrencies have gained popularity over the last decade.
