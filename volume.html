    <h1>üìä Cryptocurrency Transaction Volume & Fees</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Cryptocurrency networks now handle a substantial volume of transactions worldwide, reflecting their growing adoption. On-chain transaction volume‚Äîmeaning the total value of crypto transferred on blockchain ledgers‚Äîis on the order of trillions of US dollars per year. For example, Chainalysis data indicate that from July 2022 to June 2023, North America alone accounted for about $1.2 trillion in cryptocurrency received on-chain, representing roughly 24.4% of global transaction activity. This implies a global on-chain transaction value of around $4.9‚Äì5.0 trillion for that 12-month period.</p>

    <p>Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency network, regularly processes billions of dollars in transfers daily. Late in 2023, Bitcoin‚Äôs on-chain transfer volumes surged to over $5 billion per day, up from roughly $2.4 billion/day earlier in the year. Similarly, the Ethereum network also handles a significant volume of transactions‚Äîon the order of 1 million transactions per day‚Äîfacilitating not only Ether (ETH) transfers but also tokens and smart contract operations.</p>

    <p>These figures highlight the growing use of crypto networks for value transfer, increasingly rivaling traditional payment systems in throughput, albeit with differences in usage and capacity.</p>

    <p>High transaction volumes lead to substantial transaction fees. In cryptocurrency systems, users pay network fees to miners or validators as incentives to include transactions in blocks. Fees serve as economic signals of network usage and congestion.</p>

    <p>A research paper by D. Easley, M. O‚ÄôHara, and S. Basu (Journal of Financial Economics) argues that while fees are essential for sustainability, they may not be welfare-enhancing since everyone pays fees but transaction waiting times remain unchanged‚Äîcreating deadweight loss. The paper also notes that high fees and long wait times can hinder cryptocurrencies from functioning as transactional media.</p>

    <p>Data from 2024 show that users spent nearly $7 billion on transaction fees across major blockchains, as also reported by CoinGecko.</p>

    <h2>Exhibit 7</h2>

    <p>Ethereum earned the most in fees‚Äîabout $2.48 billion in 2024‚Äîdue to its use in decentralized finance (DeFi). Tron followed closely with ~$2.15 billion. Bitcoin collected ~$923 million, reflecting lower base-layer fee levels.</p>

    <p>In 2024, daily fees averaged $6.8 million for Ethereum and $2.5 million for Bitcoin, as shown below:</p>

    <h2>Exhibit 8</h2>

    <p>Transaction fees vary significantly during network congestion. For instance, Bitcoin fees surged to $15 per transaction in November 2023, while Ethereum fees often spiked above $10 during heavy demand. The research by Easley et al. shows that longer waiting times correlate with fewer zero-fee transactions‚Äîdemonstrating a market-based fee dynamic.</p>

    <p>Such volatility in fees reflects the limited throughput of blockchains and auction-style fee markets. High fees can price out smaller users and have led to scaling efforts such as Ethereum Layer-2 solutions and Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>

    <p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> The crypto ecosystem handles trillions in annual value and billions in fees, demonstrating wide usage but also surfacing sustainability concerns. While still smaller than global card payments, crypto volumes are catching up‚Äîdriven by tech upgrades and institutional adoption.</p>
