    <p>Cryptocurrency networks now handle a substantial volume of transactions worldwide, reflecting their growing adoption. On-chain transaction volume which means the total value of crypto transferred on blockchain ledgers is of the order of trillions of US dollars per year. For example, Chainalysis data indicate that from July 2022 to June 2023, North America alone accounted for about $1.2 trillion in cryptocurrency received on-chain, representing roughly 24.4% of global transaction activity. What thus implies is that a global on-chain transaction value of around $4.9–5.0 trillion for that 12-month period. The oldest and largest cryptocurrency network is Bitcoin and it regularly processes billions of dollars in transfers daily. Late in 2023, Bitcoin’s on-chain transfer volumes surged to over $5 billion per day, up from roughly $2.4 billion/day earlier in the year(6). Similarly  Ethereum network also handles a significant volume of transactions. The volume of transactions of Etherium is some what on the order of 1 million transactions per day. This not only facilitates transfers of its native Ether (ETH) but also a vast array of tokens and smart contract operations. These figures highlight that crypto networks are being used extensively for value transfer.  This is in turn leading to increased competition with some traditional payment networks in throughput although both of them have important differences in terms of usage and capacity.  
To put these findings into perspective, we analysed monthly transaction volumes of Bitcoin and Ethereum for the last 10 years using data available in the public datasets in Bigquery and our analysis is presented below in the form of graphical representation which shows how these cryptocurrencies have gained popularity over the last decade.

      <p>Such high transaction volume illustrated above leads us to the realisation about the high amount of transaction fees paid by users. In simple terms, how this works is that in cryptocurrency systems, users typically pay network fees to miners or validators as an incentive to include their transactions in blocks. The amount of fees is an economic indicator of the network usage and congestion. One research paper by D Easley, M O’Hara and S Basu published in Journal of Financial Economics suggests that although without transaction fees, the blockchain ecosystem would not be viable,  it however demonstrates that transaction fees are not welfare-improving for users because even when everyone pays a fee, the expected waiting time doesn't change, only miners receive more compensation, leading to a deadweight loss(11)   . The same research also alludes to the fact that Higher transaction fees and longer waiting times could impede the development of Bitcoin as a transactional medium, even as it continues to develop as a financial asset. The research paper gives a model which can be applied to other similar cryptocurrency systems like Ethereum, that use blockchain management protocols. For other cryptocurrencies also transaction fees rose due to increasing demand and fixed blockchain protocols(11). This raises concerns about the long-term viability of static rules-based protocols and the potential for fragmentation of cryptocurrencies. Please refer to the interactive dashboard to see how transaction fees for Bitcoin and Ethereum have evolved in the last decade.</p>

      <p>As seen from the exhibits above, data from 2024 show that users collectively spent nearly $7 billion on transaction fees across major blockchain platforms in that year. This is also highlighted in the article published in coingecko.(2)</p>

      <p>The exhibit above compares the average transaction fees of Ethereum and Bitcoin. Ethereum, which is widely used for decentralized finance and token transactions, earned the most in fees among all blockchains in 2024 – about $2.48 billion in total gas fees. Interestingly, the second-highest fee revenue was generated on the Tron network (~$2.15 billion in 2024), a blockchain known for fast, low-cost transfers (often used for stablecoin transactions). Although Bitcoin is more extensively used, it ranked a bit lower in fee revenue with roughly $923 million in 2024, since the base layer of Bitcoin has lower transaction throughput and periods of low fee demand except during congestion spikes. On average the daily fees of Etherium in 2024 were around $6.8 million and that of Bitcoin’s around $2.5 million. This is demonstrated in the exhibit below considering last 1 year of data.</p>

      <div class="exhibit-caption">Exhibit 8</div>
  
      <p>One of the most important characteristics of transaction fees in crypto is that it can be highly variable. During times of network congestion or hype (for instance, a surge of activity for a new De-Fi protocol or meme token) the average fees per transaction can spike by huge amount. One report noted that Bitcoin’s average transaction fee, which is often in the range of a couple of dollars, briefly spiked above $15 per transaction in November 2023 amid heavy demand(8). Ethereum’s fees are similarly demand-sensitive; in periods of intense usage, average Ethereum fees climbed into the $5–$10+ range per transaction, whereas during quieter periods they may fall well below $1. 
  The research paper by Easley, O’Hare and Basu also presents the finding that estimated waiting times are a significant explanatory factor of changes in mean transaction fees. The empirical analysis in the research paper shows a negative relationship between median waiting times and the percentage of zero-fee transactions, supporting the model's (11) prediction that as waiting times increase, users are more likely to pay fees.
  Such volatility in fees reflects the limited throughput of base-layer blockchains and the auction-like fee market that arises when many users compete to have transactions processed. High fees can price out small transactions and have spurred efforts to improve scalability (through mechanisms like layer-2 networks on Ethereum) to maintain reasonable costs.
  </p>
  
      <p><strong>In conclusion:</strong> The cryptocurrency ecosystem today processes very large transaction volumes (multi-trillion dollar annually) and collects substantial fee revenue (several billion dollars annually) from users. These metrics highlight both the adoption and usage of crypto networks at scale, and also the economic burden that users have to bear due to scalability constraints. By comparison to traditional payment systems, crypto volumes are notable – for instance, a $5 trillion annual on-chain volume is significant although still smaller than global card payment volumes – but the gap has been closing as crypto adoption grows. Going forward, trends like increasing institutional involvement and technical improvements (e.g. Ethereum’s upgrades, Bitcoin’s layer-2 Lightning Network) will influence how transaction capacity and fee levels evolve.</p>
