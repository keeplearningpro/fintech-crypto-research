      As blockchain adoption continues to rise globally, predicting the future transaction activity of Bitcoin and Ethereum is key to understanding network health, user costs, and long-term scalability. Our forecasting dashboard provides interactive projections of monthly transaction volumes and network fees for these leading cryptocurrencies, based on advanced time-series models including linear regression and Holt-Winters exponential smoothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Bitcoin, projections suggest a steady increase in transaction volume ‚Äî with expected monthly activity reaching up to 15 million transactions over the next five years. Fee levels are also forecasted to grow gradually, potentially rising from ~$20 million to ~$35 million per month, depending on network congestion and adoption of layer-2 scaling like the Lightning Network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ethereum, driven by smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs, is expected to see even steeper growth. Monthly transactions could surpass 45 million in the coming years, while annual fee revenue may climb beyond $3.5 billion. With improvements in Ethereum‚Äôs scalability stack (such as rollups and sharding), this growth may come with improved cost efficiency and throughput.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use the interactive dashboard above to select historical data range, choose your preferred prediction model, and visualize future forecasts for both Bitcoin and Ethereum. This tool is useful for researchers, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts tracking the macro-level trends of these decentralized networks.
